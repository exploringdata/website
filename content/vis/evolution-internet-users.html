<p>An animated scatterplot showing the percentage of Internet users in relation to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for the worlds countries from 1990 to 2012. Each country is represented as a bubble, whose size is determined by the countries' population. Countries are grouped by the continents they belong to using different colors.</p>
<p>Move the mouse cursor over a circle to see the name of the corresponding country. You can navigate through the years after the animation finishes by moving the mouse over the year number in the bottom right corner.</p>
