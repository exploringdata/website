<p>This is a collection of world and continent maps drawn from 419,433
IP locations. Each point on a map corresponds to a single record in the
dataset.</p>
<p>The maps were created with the
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/">Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit</a> using
the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/mill.html">Miller Cylindrical
projection</a>. You find the Python scripts for creating the images as well as
some experimental stuff in the
<a href="https://github.com/exploringdata/ip-location-maps">ip-location-maps</a>
GitHub repo.</p>
<p>The bounding boxes and centroids for the continent maps are based on
information available from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/places/info/1">flickr
places</a>. I partly adjusted the locations to reduce the amount of whitespace
and in case of Australia/Oceania to show Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea.</p>
<p>The idea to draw maps based on IP location data was inspired by projects
like Foursquare's <a href="https://foursquare.com/infographics/500million">500
million</a> and Twitter's <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/geography-tweets-3">geography of Tweets</a>
maps. The IP location data used to draw them is provided by
<a href="http://www.maxmind.com">MaxMind</a> and available in the
<a href="http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite">GeoLite City</a> dataset.</p>
