A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations from the study
The Human Disease Network, Goh K-I, Cusick ME, Valle D, Childs B, Vidal M, Barabási A-L (2007),
Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:8685-8690. Disorders and genes are nodes in the graph. A disorder's
size corresponds to the number of genes known to be associated with it. The graph dataset for
this visualization comes from the Diseasome project by Mathieu Bastian and Sébastien Heymann.
