This series of maps shows overall unemployment rates for most of the world's countries from 1991 to 2019, values for 2014 and above are projected. By default the map for 2013 is displayed, you can choose a different year from the `Choose Dataset` dropdown.

The data comes from the [International Labor Organization](http://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/global-employment-trends/2014/WCMS_233936/lang--en/index.htm). The ILO states the following about these numbers:

> Unemployment rates may differ from data published by national sources due to differences in coverage and/or definitions. In particular for 2012 and 2013, unemployment rates were estimated by the ILO in case data published by national sources were not yet available at the point of time at which the Global Employment Trends report was prepared.
