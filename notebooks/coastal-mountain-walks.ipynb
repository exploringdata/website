    "# Coastal Mountain Walks: Exploring Google Fit Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In early January 2026, I spent two weeks in and around Nerja, a small coastal town on the eastern edge of Málaga province in southern Spain. It's a place where the Sierra Almijara mountains meet the Mediterranean, and that geography made for some genuinely rewarding walking. Over the course of the trip I explored the town itself, made three trips up to the whitewashed village of Frigiliana perched in the hills above, and did a number of hikes further into the mountains, some with quite challenging terrain. Komoot's map markers were occasionally more optimistic than the trails themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the trip I tracked my activity with Google Fit on my phone, capturing steps, distance, move minutes, calories, heart points, and speed data for most of my outdoor movement. A few caveats worth keeping in mind: I didn't have my phone on me at all times, calisthenics sessions and daily stretching went untracked, and travel days to and from Nerja are excluded. Without continuous heart rate or GPS data, metrics like calories and heart points are estimates at best, so I'm treating step count as the most meaningful number to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores that activity data day by day. The goal isn't rigorous sports science; it's a personal record of how much and when I was moving through a landscape I really enjoyed. If you're curious about walking in this part of Andalusia, I hope it gives you a flavor of what's on offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the three main libraries used throughout this notebook: Polars for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Altair for visualization. A few Polars display settings are configured upfront to make sure larger tables render cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also define two small helper functions used across all charts. `chart_text` generates a consistent Altair title block with the notebook title, attribution, and an optional subtitle. `dt_convert` parses datetime strings from the raw CSV files and converts them to Madrid local time, stripping the timezone info afterward for easier handling."

A couple of columns get renamed to shorter aliases while two redundant originals are dropped. All daily subsets are then concatenated into a single DataFrame, with `Day` and `Hour` columns extracted from the start time for easier grouping later.

    "Steps, distance, and move minutes show strong positive correlations, as expected — more time moving generally means more steps and greater distance covered. Heart points show a triangular or arrowhead pattern with move minutes: you can accumulate maximum move minutes (15 per interval) with anywhere from zero to high heart points, but you can't earn heart points without move minutes. This reflects Google Fit's intensity calculation, where sustained moderate-pace walking earns move minutes but not necessarily heart points, while faster or more strenuous activity earns both. Average speed shows the weakest correlations overall, which makes sense given that speed can vary widely regardless of duration or total distance. Time of day doesn't show strong clustering patterns, suggesting activity intensity was fairly consistent whether walking in the morning, afternoon, or evening.\n",

    "For a more visual sense of the terrain, I've created a [3D Elevation Diary](https://exploring-data.com/map/3d/elevation-diary-nerja/) that matches photos I took to the actual topography of the area. If you're planning your own hikes around Nerja and Frigiliana, you can find my routes on [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/de-de/user/1493948705755/activities?type=recorded&date=2026-01-03,2026-01-15).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you track your own activity data, I'd encourage you to dig into it. Even simple metrics like daily step counts can reveal patterns you might not notice day to day, and it's a satisfying way to document a trip or training period. The code in this notebook should work with any Google Fit data exported through Google Takeout; just swap in your own CSV files and adjust the date range. Have fun analyzing your data, and thanks for reading!"
